"first blood time" means the time at which the first player dies in a match.

As a player, I can see the statistical summary of structure(tower + barracks) heatlh left standing on the winning team,
to see the importance of keeping structures standing.

As an experienced player, I can compare first blood time to match length to see the influnece
of first blood.

As a player, I can see the win percentage where the winning team has no structures remaining to see the frequency of comebacks.

As a player, I can compare game length to the amount of negative reports to see how fatigue affects player morale.

As a player, I can see how game length relates to how much strucutre the winning team has kept alive to see how long
long buildings stay up on average.
